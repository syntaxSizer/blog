###hello  I'm Qusai Alfaki
#####I am a software dev

on a daily basis, I work on complex front-end projects with up-to-date languages and technologies, and I also have a decent grasp of server-side development. While I enjoy experimenting with new frameworks and libraries, i understand the importance of placing focus on the end goal: delivering a beautiful, functional product to the user/client.I see every new experience as an opportunity to learn. My favorite projects are those that require me to push beyond my boundaries and acquire new skills and knowledge in order to succeed. When I'm not behind a computer screen, I'm out somewhere exploring, or staying home studying.
